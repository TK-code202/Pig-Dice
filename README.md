## Description

_This game involves players  (two in this case) taking turns in rolling a die as many times as they wish and summing all the numbers on each roll. The player can decide to hold, if satisfied, in which case the total outcomes of each roll for that turn is added to their total score. Whenever a player gets the number 1 as an outcome of a roll, the player loses their score for that turn and it becomes the turn of the next player. The first player to reach a total score of 100 is declared winner._
